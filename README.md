# Logistic Regression Example

This repository contains an example implementation of a Logistic Regression model using Python and scikit-learn. The example demonstrates how to classify binary data based on two features.

## Overview

Logistic Regression is a statistical model used for binary classification. It predicts the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class. This repository provides a simple implementation of Logistic Regression to classify data points into one of two categories.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this example is a synthetic dataset created for demonstration purposes. It contains two features (`feature1` and `feature2`) and a binary label (`label`).

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/logistic-regression-example.git
cd logistic-regression-example
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python logistic_regression.py
```

## Code Explanation

The code is structured as follows:

1. **Import Libraries**:
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
    ```

2. **Create a DataFrame**:
    ```python
    data = {
        'feature1': [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29],
        'feature2': [4, 9, 25, 49, 121, 169, 289, 361, 529, 841],
        'label': [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    ```

3. **Separate Features and Labels**:
    ```python
    X = df[['feature1', 'feature2']]
    y = df['label']
    ```

4. **Split Data into Training and Testing Sets**:
    ```python
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
    ```

5. **Create and Train the Logistic Regression Model**:
    ```python
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

6. **Make Predictions and Evaluate the Model**:
    ```python
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    ```

## Results

The script will output the accuracy and the classification report of the Logistic Regression model. This includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
